\subsection{Separation of the axis}

The first step to implement Aitken-Neville recursion for the Newton coefficients
in hardware is to separate the division in the divided difference into it's own
calculation. This has the advantage of separating the very costly operation of
the division from the recursive portion of the algorithm.
