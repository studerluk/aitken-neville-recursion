\section{Conclusion}

Here presented are possible hardware implementation of the Aitken-Neville
recursion with the divided difference to calculate the coefficients of a
Newton interpolation polynomial. The proposed algorithm are designed with
speed and efficiency in mind, but are limited to the special case of
equidistant data points. The speed advantages of the hardware implementation
compared to a software implementation needs to be proven. It is noteworthy
that the Newton interpolation suffers from the Runge-Kutta phenomena which
makes this interpolation method inappropriate in many cases.
